# Computational Physics 

Welcome to the Computational Physics  repository. This fun project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Julia codes for numerical analysis methods employed in computational physics. The language of codes is [Julia](https://julialang.org/) for now, but I will add C/FORTRAN codes as well. The primary inspiration for this endeavor comes from the textbook, [*Computational Methods for Physicists*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78619-3) by Simon Širca and Martin Horvat.

## Objectives

1. **Learning and Application:** The primary focus is on learning and implementing numerical analysis methods introduced in the referenced textbook.

2. **Diverse Resources:** In addition to the core material, supplementary resources will be explored and referenced, enriching the understanding and scope of computational physics.

3. **Numerical Simulations:** The repository will progressively expand to include numerical simulations of physical systems, broadening the practical application of the acquired knowledge.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the codebase and utilize the scripts for your educational and research purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we collectively enhance our understanding of computational physics.
