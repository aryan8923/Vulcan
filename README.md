# Vulcan

A collection of numerical analysis codes, examples and notes for computational physics. This is a fun project that I have taken for myself to learn the methods in depth. I will be making my notes available along with the codes (for now, only in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), but FORTRAN and C soon).
I will also be providing additional resources that are used for some method. 
There will be numerical simulations of physical systems that will be added later, but for now I wish to focus more on numerical methods themselves. 
For numerical methods, I will primarily follow the book [*Computational Methods for Physicists*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78619-3) by Simon Širca and Martin Horvat. 
## Usage

Feel free to explore the code base and utilize the scripts for your educational and research purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we collectively enhance our understanding of computational physics.

## Why "Vulcan"
This project is inspired by Vulcan in Roman mythology, emphasizing meticulous craftsmanship, precision, and the creation of powerful tools. It seeks to mirror Vulcan's dedication to forging solutions with expertise. In a similar vein to Vulcan crafting divine artifacts for the gods, the project aims to develop a sophisticated collection of computational tools. While I'm still improving my skills in this field through this project, the goal is to create efficient tools that reflect a growing mastery of the craft, providing insightful solutions in the realm of numerical analysis.
