# Vulcan

A collection of numerical analysis codes, examples and notes for computational physics. This is a fun project that I have taken for myself to learn the methods in depth. I will be making my notes available along with the codes (for now, only in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), but FORTRAN and C soon).
I will also be providing additional resources that are used for some method. 
There will be numerical simulations of physical systems that will be added later, but for now I wish to focus more on numerical methods themselves. 
For numerical methods, I will primarily follow the book [*Computational Methods for Physicists*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-78619-3) by Simon Širca and Martin Horvat. 
## Usage

Feel free to explore the code base and utilize the scripts for your educational and research purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we collectively enhance our understanding of computational physics.

## Why "Vulcan"
My computational physics project, like Vulcan in Roman mythology, embodies the essence of meticulous craftsmanship, precision, and the creation of powerful tools. Inspired by the god of fire and blacksmithing, our project mirrors Vulcan's dedication to forging solutions with expertise. In the same way Vulcan crafted divine artifacts for the gods, our project aims to create a sophisticated collection of computational tools that are not only efficient but also reflect a mastery of the craft (I am not that good at the craft yet but I wish to get better working through this project! ) , providing insightful solutions in the realm of numerical analysis.
